# Real-Time 3D Dashcam Perception System

This project transforms a regular dashcam video into a real-time 3D map with collision risk analysis. It leverages YOLO for vehicle detection, Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation, and visualizes the results in a Bird’s Eye View (BEV) with risk analysis.

## What is this project about?
- Detects vehicles (cars, motorcycles, trucks) in dashcam videos using YOLO.
- Estimates accurate metric depth from a single camera using Depth Anything V2.
- Projects pixels into 3D XYZ coordinates and renders them in BEV.
- Tracks trajectories and monitors lateral intrusion and frontal distance.
- Provides instant risk level updates with color-coded detections.

## How to fork and run
1. Clone or fork this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies (see below for numpy pinning):
   ```
   pip install numpy==1.24.4
   pip install torch==2.2.0+cpu torchvision==0.17.0+cpu --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   pip install pillow tqdm scipy==1.11.4 transformers==4.40.2 ultralytics supervision ffmpeg-python opencv-python matplotlib --no-deps
   ```
5. Place your input video (e.g., `video.mp4`) in the project directory.
6. Run the main script:
   ```
   python app.py video.mp4
   ```
7. The output video will be saved in the `output/` directory.
